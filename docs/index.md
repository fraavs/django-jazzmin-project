## Thanks
This was initially a Fork of https://github.com/wuyue92tree/django-adminlte-ui that we refactored so much we thought it
deserved its own package, big thanks to @wuyue92tree for all of his initial hard work, we are still patching into that
project were possible, but this project is taking a slightly different direction.

- Based on AdminLTE 3: https://adminlte.io/
- Using Bootstrap 4: https://getbootstrap.com/
